All people desire second chance to do things the right way. In general I believe that second chances should be given because it can change one\u2019s life.\n\nI think that employers should give ex-convicts a chance to have a normal life again. Requiring a background checks for future employees can be unfair to ex-cons. I don\u2019t think anyone should spend couple years in their life regretting a mistake they made few years ago. One bad decision should not have to represent a person life.

Moreover, I want a second chance to take my driver license. There were mandatory questions you had to pass before you drive but I failed them. I got my driver license couple weeks later after I studies harder than the previous ones.\n\nBeing giving a second chance to improve your past mistakes and wrong doing should be something to cherish with. It is a blessing because you have the chances to re-do everything in the right direction. It is just like failing a test and giving another shot to pass it. A classic example can be when I had two speeding ticket last summer. I had two chances to correct myself but I failed both unsuccessfully. Not only did I have a traffic speeding ticket on my record but I wasted my family\u2019s money. I remember I bounced back from my bad times and disciplined myself the right way. I was lucky to have parents who gave me the chances where other would not have giving to me.\n\nFinally, a second chance is a wonderful thing to be given. People should take advantage of it just like Malcolm X did when he was giving the second chance. He educated himself in the prison to become a better person. For so many successfully personals they were giving a second chance and corrected their previous mistakes.

Moreover, I want a second chance to take my driver license. There were mandatory questions you had to pass before you drive but I failed them. I got my driver license couple weeks later after I studies harder than the previous ones.\n\nBeing giving a second chance to improve your past mistakes and wrong doing should be something to cherish with. It is a blessing because you have the chances to re-do everything in the right direction. It is just like failing a test and giving another shot to pass it. A classic example can be when I had two speeding ticket last summer. I had two chances to correct myself but I failed both unsuccessfully. Not only did I have a traffic speeding ticket on my record but I wasted my family\u2019s money. I remember I bounced back from my bad times and disciplined myself the right way. I was lucky to have parents who gave me the chances where other would not have giving to me.\n\nFinally, a second chance is a wonderful thing to be given. People should take advantage of it just like Malcolm X did when he was giving the second chance. He educated himself in the prison to become a better person. For so many successfully personals they were giving a second chance and corrected their previous mistakes. I wish so many people who ended up in the streets after they were released from person should have those chances to correct themselves.", "emotes": [], "images": []}, {"username": "SergeantIncel", "user_title": "Admincel", "post_time": "1529024967", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nNov 7, 2017\n\n\nMessages\n1,651\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033217im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/0/1.jpg?1537119326", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "While I do agree that seconds chances are important (that's why I created the whole ban appeal section in the first place), I don't believe your behavior warrants one, it has just been too disruptive and disrespectful of the rules.\n\nIf that is not a good enough reason for you, then know that we do not unban accounts more than one time per the rules in the sticky, and you were already unbanned once.", "clean_text": "\nWhile I do agree that seconds chances are important (that's why I created the whole ban appeal section in the first place), I don't believe your behavior warrants one, it has just been too disruptive and disrespectful of the rules.\n\nIf that is not a good enough reason for you, then know that we do not unban accounts more than one time per the rules in the sticky, and you were already unbanned once.", "emotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"title": "there's been a massive misunderstanding", "label": null, "link": "/web/20181120212634/https://incels.is/threads/theres-been-a-massive-misunderstanding.52538/", "author": "Junkyard Roach", "time": "1529022892", "messages": [{"username": "Junkyard Roach", "user_title": "No friends only enemies", "post_time": "1529022892", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nFeb 5, 2018\n\n\nMessages\n625\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033235im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/3/3272.jpg?1528946185", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "again I don't know why I was banned again, if it's because of @whogivesafucc for the one billionth time I am not him ik him irl thats all, you guys seen my pictures, you have no proof that I am him or pretending to be him, for Christ sake's stop banning me im completely innocent @Ryo_Hazuki", "clean_text": "\nagain I don't know why I was banned again, if it's because of @whogivesafucc for the one billionth time I am not him ik him irl thats all, you guys seen my pictures, you have no proof that I am him or pretending to be him, for Christ sake's stop banning me im completely innocent @Ryo_Hazuki", "emotes": [], "images": []}, {"username": "knajjd", "user_title": "Modcel", "post_time": "1529022948", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nNov 7, 2017\n\n\nMessages\n1,910\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033235im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/0/63.jpg?1542612107", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "you were supposed to tag the mod too. @Ryo_Hazuki", "clean_text": "\nyou were supposed to tag the mod too. @Ryo_Hazuki", "emotes": [], "images": []}, {"username": "Junkyard Roach", "user_title": "No friends only enemies", "post_time": "1529023015", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nFeb 5, 2018\n\n\nMessages\n625\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033235im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/3/3272.jpg?1528946185", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "sorry", "clean_text": "\nsorry", "emotes": [], "images": []}, {"username": "Ryo_Hazuki", "user_title": "Modcel", "post_time": "1529023973", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nNov 7, 2017\n\n\nMessages\n3,730\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033235im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/0/82.jpg?1519694020", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "Not buying it dude.", "clean_text": "\nNot buying it dude.", "emotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"title": "Said i was a girl", "label": null, "link": "/web/20181120212634/https://incels.is/threads/said-i-was-a-girl.52418/", "author": "Frigidx", "time": "1528991106", "messages": [{"username": "Frigidx", "user_title": "Banned", "post_time": "1528991106", "joined": "\n\nJoined\nMay 5, 2018\n\n\nMessages\n25\n\n", "avatar": "/web/20181121033252im_/https://incels.is/data/avatars/l/6/6554.jpg?1528956520", "quotes": null, "raw_text": "Banned by @knajjd \nI dont see what I did to make anyone assume I was a female??
